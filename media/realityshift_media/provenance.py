"""Simulation provenance, bound into the Genblaze manifest.

The project's defining property — once a fork splits, no real-world data enters
it — is invisible in a finished video. Embedding it in the manifest, where it is
part of the canonical SHA-256, makes it verifiable: `genblaze verify` on a
downloaded asset re-derives the hash, so the simulation fields cannot be altered
without breaking verification.

Verified on genblaze-core 0.3.8 (schema 1.5): Run.metadata is included in the
canonical hash, and changing simulation.fork_id changes the hash. See
media/tests/test_provenance.py.
